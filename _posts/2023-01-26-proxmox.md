# Presentation of my Homelab Virtualization Server

This is a Hypervisor type-1. We are going to dive deeper into the world of virtualization and start messing with Type 1 Hypervisors like Proxmox, ESXi..etc. We can take any old laptop or PC and convert it into a Virtual Machine power house!! We'll go through a complete Proxmox install.

Either we have an old laptop or PC that we don't need, procceess is the same. In my case I bought a mini pc 32 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD

Prerequisites
* USB flash drive (minimum 8Gb)
* lan cable
* old laptop or PC

First we have to Download Proxmox and prepare the USB flash drive with rufus tool

**Proxmox:**  Official Download page for Proxmox PVE ISO image https://proxmox.com/en/downloads

Select Proxmox Virtual Environment

Navigate to the Proxmox Virtual Environment archive that stores ISO images and official documentation. Select and dowmload latest ISO Images to continue

After download complete "burn" the iso into USB flash drive with my favourite tool Rufus

### Proxmox installer proccess

- Move to the server (machine) where I want to install Proxmox and plug in the USB flash drive.
- Power on the server (machine) and while is booting up, access the boot menu by pressing the required keyboard key(s). Most commonly, they are either Esc, F10 or F11, depends your motherborad manufacturer.
- Select the installation media with the Proxmox ISO image and boot from it. Next, the Proxmox VE menu appears.
- Following the official step-by-step installation guide, proccedd to standard installation https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Installation
- After the installation is completed, remove the USB drive and reboot the system.

Once the installation is completed and the system rebooted itself.\
After a while, the Proxmox VE welcome message appears. It includes the IP address that have been configured due installation process which loads Proxmox. Navigate to that IP address in a web browser of my choice.

Most likely see a warning message that the page is unsafe because Proxmox VE uses self-signed SSL certificates. Select to proceed to the Proxmox web management interface.\
To access the interface, log in as root and provide the password set when installing Proxmox.
